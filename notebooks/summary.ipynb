    "# Employee Performance Prediction Model Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project was to analyze employee data to predict employee performance ratings at a company. The ability to predict high and low performers can help with talent management decisions like promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data \n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data contained around 1200 records with 27 features describing employee details like demographics, tenure, job satisfaction, etc. The target variable was `PerformanceRating` which needed to be predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Various preprocessing techniques were applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing value handling:** No missing values were present.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outlier handling:** Detected and capped outliers in features like `TotalWorkExperienceInYears`, `TrainingTimesLastYear` etc using IQR ranges. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Categorical encoding:** Converted categorical features like `Gender`, `MaritalStatus` etc into numeric using manual and frequency-based encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature scaling:** Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler to normalize distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality reduction:** Applied PCA and reduced dimensions from 27 to 25 by preserving over 90% variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "Performed detailed exploratory analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Univariate analysis** on continuous features like `Age`, `EmpHourlyRate` using histograms. Analyzed categorical features like `Department` using bar plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bivariate analysis** using correlation matrix and scatter plots between features like `Age` and `EmpLastSalaryHikePercent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multivariate analysis** by generating pairplots to understand interactions between multiple features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Features like `TotalWorkExperienceInYears` exhibited right skewed distributions. Applied transformations like square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most employees received 11-15% `EmpLastSalaryHikePercent`. `EmpRelationshipSatisfaction` was Fairly Good.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Attributes like `YearsSinceLastPromotion` provided insights into career growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Building and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimented with 3 supervised ML models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support Vector Machine:** Achieved 98.10% testing accuracy after tuning using GridSearch. Overfitted training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Forest:** Tuning did not improve test accuracy (95.24%) by much. Overfitted on training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multilayer Perceptron:** Got 96.19% test accuracy without tuning due to better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selected **Multilayer Perceptron** as optimal model based on superior test performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Diagnostics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculated evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. Generated classification reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created confusion matrix to analyze types of correct and incorrect predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualized feature distributions and correlations to diagnose data issues.\n",

    "**Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance**\n",

    "- Critical factors like work experience, training times and relationship satisfaction were analyzed.\n",

    "The Multilayer Perceptron model gave 96% test accuracy with good generalization capability. Followed a structured machine learning workflow involving data preprocessing, model building, diagnostics and optimizations. The end-to-end implementation, analysis and choice of final model were appropriate."
