# Employee Performance Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to analyze employee performance based on various factors and develop a predictive model to anticipate performance ratings. The dataset used includes information about employees' demographics, education, job details, and work-related factors.

## Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Univariate and bivariate analysis of key attributes.
- Data visualization to gain insights into employee performance.
- Creation of predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Model evaluation and selection.
- Recommendations for improving employee performance based on insights.

## Key Attributes

- `EmpNumber`: Unique identifier for each employee.
- `Age`: Age of the employee.
- `Gender`: Gender of the employee (Male/Female).
- `EducationBackground`: Educational background of the employee (Marketing, Technical Degree, etc.).
- `MaritalStatus`: Marital status of the employee (Single, Married, Divorced).
- `EmpDepartment`: Department the employee works in (Sales, Research & Development, etc.).
- `EmpJobRole`: Specific job role of the employee.
- `BusinessTravelFrequency`: How frequently the employee travels for business.
- `DistanceFromHome`: Distance between the employee's home and office.
- ... (Include all relevant attributes)

## Project Goals

1. Analyze department-wise employee performance.
2. Identify the top factors affecting employee performance.
3. Develop a predictive model for employee performance.
4. Provide recommendations for performance improvement.

## Project Structure

- `data.csv`: Dataset containing employee information.
- `Employee_Performance_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
- `mlp_classifier_model.pkl`: Pickled MLP Classifier model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required for this project.
